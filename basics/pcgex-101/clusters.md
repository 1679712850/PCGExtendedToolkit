# Clusters

Key takeaway:\
\- Vtx and Edges are separated but bounds by tags\
\- A single Vtx dataset covers multiple dataset by default\
\- A single Edge dataset represent a connectivity "cluster"\
\- Edges and Vtx are still "just points"

## Don't mess with PCGEx/

What makes PCGEx points _peeceegeeayksey_ are special attributes & tags â€” all of which are conveniently prefixed with `PCGEx/`.

{% hint style="danger" %}
PCGEx rely on these to work, serialize internal data, and maintain relationships.\
If you're curious, you can read more about the how's and why's in the dedicated technical note.
