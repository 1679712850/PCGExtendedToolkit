# Technical Note : PCGEx Framework

## Performance Settings

There are a few performance options available to get a bit of a low-level influence on how PCGEx do things. Have a look at the [PCGEx Framework technical note](technical-note-pcgex-framework.md) to get a better sense of their context.

{% hint style="info" %}
Defaults performance settings are all good â€” they are mostly in the realm of micro-optimization and much else.
{% endhint %}

<table><thead><tr><th width="210">Setting</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Work Priority</strong></td><td>Work Priority lets you choose the priority of the async tasks spawned by that node.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cache Data</strong></td><td>Lets you choose the caching behavior for that node.<br>- <code>Default</code> will use the value set in the plugin settings (<em>Disabled by default</em>)<br>- <code>Enabled</code> will enable data caching.<br>- <code>Disabled</code> will disable data caching.<br><br><em>Not all nodes react well to caching, and a handful of nodes simply don't support it and won't change behavior based on the setting value.</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Flatten Output</strong></td><td>If enabled, the node will output flattened data; meaning there is no more parenting or inheritance of the metadata. <br><br><strong>This takes a huge toll on memory usage and should only be used when exporting data to a <code>PCGDataAsset</code>.</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Scoped Attribute Get</strong></td><td>This is a highly circumstantial setting: when enabled (and supported), the node will read attribute values it relies on in small chunks on a "per-need" basis; while if disabled, the entirety of the values is cached in a single go. <a href="technical-note-pcgex-framework.md#scoped-chunked-attribute-reading"><em>Read more about that here.</em></a><br><br><br>You may choose the following values:<br>- <code>Default</code> will use the value set in the plugin settings (<em>Enabled by default</em>)<br>- <code>Enabled</code> will enable chunked read.<br>- <code>Disabled</code> will disable chunked read.</td></tr></tbody></table>
