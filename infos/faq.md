# FAQ

## What's the roadmap?

Currently the "roadmap" is **largely driven by user needs and requests**, and I prioritize making sure user can safely migrate their content to the latest updates of the engine.

ðŸ‘† There's a barebone Trello board to provide some visibility.

## Do you work with the editor' main branch?

**No.**

Even if I wish I could, I simply don't have the hardware to compile the engine from source and prepare the codebase for upcoming releases, so **I rely solely on preview binaries in the Epic Launcher to start updating the plugin.**
