# Mark Mutual Relations ![Relational](https://img.shields.io/badge/Relational-306fd6)

## What is it useful for?
This node processes points that have gone through any relation-establishing element (i.e [Build Relations](PCGExBuildRelations.md)) and flag relations that are shared between points.  

> The reason why this is its own node is that it can be computationally intensive to maintain, and is rarely needed.
