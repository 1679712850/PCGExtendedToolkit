  <p><strong>Important note on weighting up visited <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vtx</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Edges</code>:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The weight is only computed for the pathfinding node and isn’t carried over or cached.</li>
    <li>Enabling this feature breaks parallelism. Task are still ran asynchronously, but each path must wait for the previous one to be computed. Impact is usually negligible, but if you have <em>lots</em> of paths, it may take noticeably more time to process.</li>
  </ul>
