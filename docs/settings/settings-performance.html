      <td>Do Async Processing</td>
      <td>Checked by default, you can toggle it off to force synchronous/unparallelized execution of the code. <em>It’s usually a bad idea performance-wise.</em><br> &gt; Note that synchronous execution still processes data in <em>chunks</em>, it just does it with guaranteed order, as opposed to parallel processing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chunk Size</td>
      <td>The chunk size represents the number of point/operations a node will process in a single parallel batch. There is no ideal value: too small and you loose the gain of parallelization, too high and you’re just hogging thread ressources. <strong>Ultimately, it depends on your specific setup.</strong><br>A value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-1</code> fallbacks to that specific’ node default value under the hood, which is usually a generic sweet spot; ranging from 64 to 4096 depending on the node.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cache Result</td>
      <td>Under the hood, all PCG node come with the ability to cache their result; but the system is designed so it’s a compile-time choice, not an editor-time one <strong>(at least in 5.3)</strong>. I exposed the ability to cache on-demand at the price of some harmless asserts, because once you’re done iterating on certain settings, it’s worth caching the results.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Flatten Output</td>
      <td>When enabled, all of the node output attributes will be flattened; primarily meaning that their metadata (attributes) are not inheriting parents, and the node can be safely saved to a data asset.<br> <em>It’s a rather costly operation, so make sure you need it, and for the sake of your RAM, don’t enable it otherwise.</em>
