## What is it useful for?
Project is a boilerplate for translation & rotation operation to fit a point on a surface defined by normal and a position.

Project uses the vector data from nodes like [Sample Nearest Point](PCGExSampleNearestPoint.md), [Sample Nearest Surface](PCGExSampleNearestSurface.md) or [Sample Surface Guided](PCGExSampleSurfaceGuided.md) to alter point' transforms.
