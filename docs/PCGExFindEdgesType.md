# Find Edges Type ![Graph](https://img.shields.io/badge/Graph-37a573)

## What is it useful for?
This node processes points that have gone through any relation-establishing element (i.e [Build Graph](PCGExBuildGraph.md)) and flag relations (edges) that are shared between points.  

> Note that certain nodes either offer to calculate the relation type internally, or simply compute the relation type as a byproduct of their primary task (i.e [Consolidate Graph](PCGExConsolidateGraph.md).)
