# Pathfinding Algorithms

Pathfinding algorithms are pieces of code used to search for a path inside a given graph.  
Each algorithm has its strenghts and weaknesses and may produce different results, or use modifiers in different ways.

Right now, there are two main implementation available of the two widely popular algorithms:
- [A* (A Star)](#a*)
- [Djikstra](#Djikstra)
