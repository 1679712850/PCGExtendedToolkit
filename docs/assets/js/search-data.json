    "content": "Yes. It‚Äôs ok, you can ignore these. PCG isn‚Äôt natively architectured to support node that switch between cacheable/not-cacheable, which sometime generates failed checks. It‚Äôs annoying but is harmless. The benefits of switching caching mode outweights the assert in my opinion ‚Äì if that bugs you, don‚Äôt touch to the checkbox, it‚Äôs generally safer not to ship with cached data anyway. ",

    "content": "I made this. Follow @Nebukam . I made PCGEx as a way to bring some my personal Houdini toolkit into Unreal, and figured it could be useful to my fellow artists and designers. I love my current workflow &amp; tools when it comes to procedural generation, and often needed ways to generate data &amp; structures to‚Ä¶ well, generate more data and structures to spawn stuff on. Unreal PCG has powerful tools to generate and work with splines, but unless you‚Äôre making them by hand, spline are a pain to manipulate and maintain at scale ‚Äì that‚Äôs the main reason why I wanted to have tools to create graphs and pathfind in them. Turns out, it‚Äôs useful for plenty of other things :) . Special Thanks . Massive kudo to MikeC, who has been an early adopter, and whose feedback and suggestions tremendously helped make PCGEx a better and more useful tool &lt;3 Also thanks to Sinbad, as I shamelessly pasted some of his C++ formatting and practices for this documentation ^_^ . Source code . PCGEx is licensed under MIT : if you want to look at the code, or if you‚Äôre worried it could hurt your machine, the code is available in full on github. It does not rely on nor embbed any third party library/dlls. Bugs! . If you encounter a bug, please fill an issue here. Please provide as much information as you can (stack traces, node setup, ‚Ä¶).

As mentionned in the Working with Clusters page, Vtx and Edge points are storing critical attributes &amp; informations about the topology of a cluster. Sanitize removes Edges which Vtx have been removed, as well as prune Vtx that aren‚Äôt participating to any Edge. Additionally, if a cluster that was previously a bit interconnected topology has been split into smaller groups, this will be reflected in the Edges output with additional point datasets. Note that all cluster nodes output sanitized clusters by design, so there is no need to use this node after ‚Äúofficial‚Äù PCGEx operations.

For the example, let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre working on a dataset with 10 points that have a float attribute with the following values: . Absolute values = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 55, 60, 1200, 500} Relative values = {0.0083, 0.016, 0.025, 0.03, 0.041, 0.041, 0.045, 0.05, 1, 0.41} . | Average | Median | Mode | Central | Fixed | . Average (Arithmetic mean) . Average mean is, well, the averaged value of all the values. Absolute Average Mean = 201.5 Relative Average Mean = 0.125 . Median . Median uses the median value of all the available lengths, sorted. Sorted Absolute values = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 55, 60, 500, 1200] Absolute Median Mean = 50 // [.., 50, 50, ...] Sorted Relative values = [0.0083, 0.016, 0.025, 0.03, 0.041, 0.041, 0.045, 0.05, 0.41, 1] Relative Median Mean = 0.041 // [.., 0.041, 0.041, ...] . Mode (Shortest or Longest) . See Mode (statitics) on Wikipedia. If there are concurrent mode values (multiple buckets containing the same amount of values), the selected mode variant allows you to select either the mode with the smalles values, or the one with the largest out of the available conflicting modes. Absolute Mode Mean = 50 // [50, 50] is the largest bucket of equal values Absolute Mode Mean = 0.041 // [0.041, 0.041] is the largest bucket of equal values . In this is scenario, there is no conflicting frequencies. The Mode Tolerance property is used to fill frequency buckets based on equality with already sampled values. Central . Central uses the middle value between the smallest and largest values as mean. Absolute Central Mean = 605 // 10 + (1200-10)/2 Relative Central Mean = 0.504 // 0.0083 + (1-0.0083)/2 . Fixed . Fixed mean is basically user-defined mean. This is the way to go if you don‚Äôt care about statistics or if you have a consistent, metrics-driven setup. This is the least flexible but most performant approach as there is no need to compute any statistics prior to pruning. ",

Note: The Seed and Goal node are picked based on closest distance to input positions. Starting from the seed, each ‚Äúnext step‚Äù is weighted according to the V Vertex weight and the E Edge weight that connects to it. The search returns the path found with the lowest possible weight, or score. While the selected search algorithm is important, üù∞ Heuristics are more critical to the operation, as user-defined weights can drastically change and shape the path deemed best by the search. Note: The Plot nodes variations don‚Äôt have a goal picker and instead process each point Dataset as a list of points to go through from start to finish. The first point is the initial seed, the last point is the final goal, and then a path is found that goes through each point in-between, in order. ",

Table of content . | Creating new collections | Rebuilding staging data | Available Collections | . Asset Collections are basically lists of assets that you can then use inside PCG; that all share some basic properties. They exist in different flavors, for different purposes (i.e actors vs meshes), but their main appeal over Data Table or PCG Data Asset is caching and nesting. Cached bounds data . Each entry has some basic information cached, amongst which the bounds of the referenced asset. This is especially useful as it allows nodes to access an asset bounds‚Äô without having to load the asset in memory. It enables nodes like Asset Staging to do some interesting work on points before spawning anything in the world. Nested collections . Each entry can be another collection. This is where the Asset Collection shines, because a collection can be weighted like any other entry. PCGEx will recognize sub-collection and will keep on digging in these until an asset is found. This is particulary handy when doing random weighted selection, where you want only a subset of items to be associated to a particular weight range, and then have a new random weighted pick from inside that range. Collections can be nested without limits, offering highly granular control over weighted &amp; random distribution. Re-usability &amp; templating . Since they‚Äôre regular DataAssets, Asset Collections can easily be extended, re-used, shared amongst different settings &amp; PCG setups. Convertible . In order to support any workflow, Asset Collection to Set makes it easy to convert any PCGEx‚Äô Asset Collection to a good ol‚Äô attribute set, on the fly.

Statistics . | Statistics | ¬† | . | ‚Äî | | . | **Extra Weighting**| | ¬† | . | Weight up Visited | If enabled, points and edges will accumulate additional weight are paths are found.This allows you to make \"already in use\" points &amp; edges either more or less desirable for the next internal execution. | . | Visited Points Weight Factor | The weight to add to points that have been visited. This is a multiplier of the Heuristic‚Äô Modifiers Reference Weight.*The weight is added each time a point is used.* | . | Visited Edges Weight Factor | The weight to add to edges that have been visited. This is a multiplier of the Heuristic‚Äô Modifiers Reference Weight.*The weight is added each time an edge is used.* | . Important note on weighting up visited Vtx and Edges: . | The weight is only computed for the pathfinding node and isn‚Äôt carried over or cached. | Enabling this feature breaks parallelism. Tasks are still ran asynchronously, but each path must wait for the previous one to be computed. Impact is usually negligible, but if you have lots of paths, it may take noticeably more time to process. | . ",

Most of the time it‚Äôs a non-issue, but may be noticeable if you have a lot of very large datasets plugged into the same node. Do Async Processing . Checked by default, you can toggle it off to force synchronous/unparallelized execution of the code. This is a very legacy option, best leave it to true. Chunk Size . The chunk size usually represents the number of point a node will process in a single parallel batch. There is no ideal value: too small and you loose the gain of parallelization, too high and you‚Äôre just hogging thread ressources. Ultimately, it depends on your specific setup. A value of -1 fallbacks to that specific‚Äô node default value under the hood. Unreal PCG plugin recommend a minimum batch size of 256, which is the default value I‚Äôm using for most of the nodes. Heavier operations can go as low as 32. Cache Result . Under the hood, all PCG node come with the ability to cache their result; but the system is designed so it‚Äôs a compile-time choice, not an editor-time one. I exposed the ability to cache on-demand at the price of some harmless asserts, because once you‚Äôre done iterating on certain settings, it‚Äôs worth caching the results. Be aware that the cache is easily corrupted, and sometime leads to missing points or data; it‚Äôs still a small price to pay when you‚Äôre working iteratively with hundreds of thousands points. Flatten Output . Flatten the output of this node. On 5.3 this is a very expensive operation, it‚Äôs better in 5.4 and should be even faster in 5.5. Flattening ensure all inherited attribute values are copied to the output, and metadata parenting/inheritance is forfeited in the process. This is a required step to ensure attribute values are properly saved to PCG Data Assets! . ",

    "content": "Vtx? Edges? . A summary of what ‚Äúgraph‚Äù means and entails in the context of PCGEx. One of the main focus of PCGEx is working with Clusters : vtx &amp; edge-based ‚Äúgraph‚Äù structures. They‚Äôre akin to a mesh without faces: a bunch of vertices connected by a bunch of edges. PCGEx leverage PCG‚Äô point data as data holders in order to enable easy tweaking and manipulation of edge/vertice data using existing vanilla nodes. In short, a graph is represented by at least two separate set of points: the first, Vtx represent individual vertices; others, Edges, represent interconnected clusters. Edges points stores the indices of their start and end point in the matching Vtx group. Because of that approach, nodes that work with graph require Vtx and Edges as separate inputs. Data Tags are used to mark which edges match which vertices, so you will see additional tags appear on your data, formatted as PCGEx/XXX. Rule of thumb : If you manually alter (as in add or remove points) the content of a Vtx or Edges created by a PCGEx Node, make sure to use the Sanitize Clusters node before using them as inputs for other PCGEx nodes.

Alternatively, Edges have a PCGEx/EdgeEndpoints attribute whose first 32 bits matches their start‚Äô Vtx unique ID, and the last 32 bits are the edge‚Äô end Vtx unique ID. Put together, this data is used to rebuild clusters in memory. If you manually alter (read : using native nodes) the number of points in either Vtx or Edges dataset, make sure to use Sanitize Clusters to restore the coherence of these attributes. Rule of thumb : The only information that matter on Edges for clusters is their start and end attribute. Their position in space is ignored so feel free to use those points if they can be relevant to you. ",

The UID used for the tagging is NOT deterministic, and will change at each execution of the graph, and for each node. It is used under the hood only, and should not be edited, nor relied upon for any kind of tag-related operations. For the same reason, if you create custom tags starting with PCGEx/, it will break existing vtx/edge associations. Because of the reliance on the tagging system, if you edit Vtx and Edges before using them with a PCGEx node, make sure tags are preserved. I‚Äôm working on more robust way to assciate the data beyond tags, but sadly tagging is the most bulletproof and reliable method I found. Underlying data types are always at the risk of not being preserved if they‚Äôre not properly duplicated, which can happen in earlier/experimental version of PCG that this plugin is supporting. ",
