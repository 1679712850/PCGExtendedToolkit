    "content": "Yes. It’s ok, you can ignore these. PCG isn’t natively architectured to support node that switch between cacheable/not-cacheable, which sometime generates failed checks. It’s annoying but is harmless. The benefits of switching caching mode outweights the assert in my opinion – if that bugs you, don’t touch to the checkbox, it’s generally safer not to ship with cached data anyway. ",

    "title": "I’m Tim!",
    "content": "I made this. Follow @Nebukam . I made PCGEx as a way to bring some my personal Houdini toolkit into Unreal, and figured it could be useful to my fellow artists and designers. I love my current workflow &amp; tools when it comes to procedural generation, and often needed ways to generate data &amp; structures to… well, generate more data and structures to spawn stuff on. Unreal PCG has powerful tools to generate and work with splines, but unless you’re making them by hand, spline are a pain to manipulate and maintain at scale – that’s the main reason why I wanted to have tools to create graph and pathfinding them. Turns out, it’s useful for plenty of other things :) . Special Thanks . Massive kudo to MikeC, who has been an early adopter, and whose feedback and suggestions tremendously helped make PCGEx a better and more useful tool &lt;3 Also thanks to Sinbad, as I shamelessly pasted some of his C++ formatting and practices for this documentation ^_^ . Source code . PCGEx is licensed under MIT : if you want to look at the code, or if you’re worried it could hurt your machine, the code is available in full on github.

If points are equally spaced, it will look very similar to Point Count. Count . Point Count uses the current point index, and compute their individual lerp as Current Index / Total Point Count.

The Prune Below value is substracted from that average to find the minimum acceptable length (in relative terms), while the Prune Above value is added to that average to find the maximum acceptable length. In other words, if the average relative mean is 0.5, using Prune Below = 0.1 and Prune Above = 0.1, edges with a relative length &lt; 0.4 and &gt; 0.6 will be pruned. See Easy pruning if this gives you headaches.

For the example, let’s say we’re working on a cluster with 10 edges that have the following lengths: . Absolute lengths = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 55, 60, 1200, 500] Relative lengths = [0.0083, 0.016, 0.025, 0.03, 0.041, 0.041, 0.045, 0.05, 1, 0.41] . | Average | Median | Mode | Central | Fixed | . Average (Arithmetic mean) . Average mean is, well, the averaged value of all the lengths. Absolute Average Mean = 201.5 Relative Average Mean = 0.125 . Median . Median uses the median value of all the available lengths, sorted. Sorted Absolute lengths = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 55, 60, 500, 1200] Absolute Median Mean = 50 // [.., 50, 50, ...] Sorted Relative lengths = [0.0083, 0.016, 0.025, 0.03, 0.041, 0.041, 0.045, 0.05, 0.41, 1] Relative Median Mean = 0.041 // [.., 0.041, 0.041, ...] . Mode (Shortest or Longest) . See Mode (statitics) on Wikipedia. If there are concurrent mode values (multiple buckets containing the same amount of values), the selected mode variant allows you to select either the mode with the shortest lengths, or the one with the longest out of the available conflicting modes. Absolute Mode Mean = 50 // [50, 50] is the largest bucket of equal values Absolute Mode Mean = 0.041 // [0.041, 0.041] is the largest bucket of equal values . In this is scenario, there is no conflicting frequencies. The Mode Tolerance property is used to fill frequency buckets based on equality with already sampled values. Central . Central uses the middle value between the shortest and longest lengths as mean. Absolute Central Mean = 605 // 10 + (1200-10)/2 Relative Central Mean = 0.504 // 0.0083 + (1-0.0083)/2 . Fixed . Fixed mean is basically user-defined mean. This is the way to go if you don’t care about statistics or if you have a consistent, metrics-driven setup. This is the least flexible but most performant approach as there is no need to sample any statistics prior to pruning. ",

Note: The Seed and Goal node are picked based on closest distance to input positions. Starting from the seed, each “next step” is weighted according to the V Vertex weight and the E Edge weight that connects to it. The search returns the path found with the lowest possible weight, or score. While the selected search algorithm is important, Heuristic Modifiers are even more critical to the operation, as user-defined weights can drastically change and shape the path deemed best by the search. Note: The Plot nodes variations don’t have a goal picker and instead process each point data set as a list of points to go through from start to finish. The first point is the initial seed, the last point is the final goal, and then a path is found that goes through each point in-between, in order. ",

The curve is expected to stay normalized in the 0-1 range on the y axis, and is sampled in the 0-1 range on the x axis. Just keep in mind the resulting sampled value will be made absolute (non-negative), and is used as a multiplier. ",

A - Linear . This is the default, linear curve. It doesn’t modulate weight, so the final weight will closely match the attribute range. | Raw attribute value | → Remapped to | → Sampled at | → Final weight | . | -50 | 0.0 | 0 | **0** | . | -25 | 0.25 | 0.25 | **25** | . | 0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | **50** | . | 25 | 0.75 | 0.75 | **75** | . | 50 | 1.0 | 1.0 | **100** | . B - Expo . Exponential curve is very useful to emphasize higher values and “ignore” lower ones. This can be especially useful when the attribute is for example the edge length, the resulting weight would strongly discourage long edges . | Raw attribute value | → Remapped to | → Sampled at | → Final weight | . | -50 | 0.0 | 0.0 | **0** | . | -25 | 0.25 | 0.01 | **1** | . | 0 | 0.5 | 0.05 | **5** | . | 25 | 0.75 | 0.25 | **25** | . | 50 | 1.0 | 1.0 | **100** | . C - Inverse Expo . Inverted curve (exponential or not) curve is very useful to, well, inverse the weight. This is especially handy if you want to discourage smaller values and ignore higher ones. | Raw attribute value | → Remapped to | → Sampled at | → Final weight | . | -50 | 0.0 | 1 | **100** | . | -25 | 0.25 | 0.25 | **25** | . | 0 | 0.5 | 0.05 | **5** | . | 25 | 0.75 | 0.01 | **1** | . | 50 | 1.0 | 0 | **0** | . D - Yoyo . This is really just here to make a comparison with other more classic approaches.

Almost every node in the PCGEx inherit from the same point processor, and as such they have some shared capabilities. PCGEx has a focus on performance and multithreading – very few nodes are actively computing anything on the main thread, and instead the bulk of the tasks is handled asynchronously; and parallelized whenever possible. This helps keeping the editor relatively smooth when performing heavy tasks. Because of the parallelization, a very few select nodes have non-deterministic outputs; meaning they will yield slightly different results between two runs. These nodes are flagged in the doc. This is something I’m working to fix to ensure all nodes have deterministic results.

(This is a cheap workaround to ensure deterministic result in nodes that are otherwise non-deterministic due to parallel processing) . Note that synchronous execution still processes data in chunks, it just does it with guaranteed order, as opposed to parallel processing. Chunk Size . The chunk size usually represents the number of point a node will process in a single parallel batch. There is no ideal value: too small and you loose the gain of parallelization, too high and you’re just hogging thread ressources. Ultimately, it depends on your specific setup. A value of -1 fallbacks to that specific’ node default value under the hood. Unreal PCG plugin recommend a minimum batch size of 256, which is the default value I’m using for most of the nodes. Heavier operations can go as low as 32. Cache Result . Under the hood, all PCG node come with the ability to cache their result; but the system is designed so it’s a compile-time choice, not an editor-time one. I exposed the ability to cache on-demand at the price of some harmless asserts, because once you’re done iterating on certain settings, it’s worth caching the results. Be aware that the cache is easily corrupted, and sometime leads to missing points or data; it’s still a small price to pay when you’re working iteratively with hundreds of thousands points. ",

They’re akin to a mesh without faces: a bunch of vertices connected by a bunch of edges. PCGEx leverage PCG’ point data as data holders in order to enable easy tweaking and manipulation of edge/vertice data using existing vanilla nodes. In short, a graph is represented by at least two separate set of points: the first, Vtx represent individual vertices; others, Edges, represent interconnected clusters. Edges points stores the indices of their start and end point in the matching Vtx group. Because of that approach, nodes that work with graph require Vtx and Edges as separate inputs. Data Tags are used to mark which edges match which vertices, so you will see additional tags appear on your data, formatted as PCGEx/Cluster::UID. Rule of thumb : If you manually alter (as in add or remove points) the content of a Vtx or Edges created by a PCGEx Node, make sure to use the Sanitize Clusters node before using them as inputs for other PCGEx nodes.

The PCGEx/CachedEdgeNum attribute hold the number of edges connected to that Vtx when it was written into a graph. It is solely used for validation purposes when rebuilding a cluster to process it.
