    "content": "Yes. It‚Äôs ok, you can ignore these. PCG isn‚Äôt natively architectured to support node that switch between cacheable/not-cacheable, which sometime generates failed checks. It‚Äôs annoying but is harmless. The benefits of switching caching mode outweights the assert in my opinion ‚Äì if that bugs you, don‚Äôt touch to the checkbox, it‚Äôs generally safer not to ship with cached data anyway. ",

    "content": "I made this. Follow @Nebukam . I made PCGEx as a way to bring some my personal Houdini toolkit into Unreal, and figured it could be useful to my fellow artists and designers. I love my current workflow &amp; tools when it comes to procedural generation, and often needed ways to generate data &amp; structures to‚Ä¶ well, generate more data and structures to spawn stuff on. Unreal PCG has powerful tools to generate and work with splines, but unless you‚Äôre making them by hand, spline are a pain to manipulate and maintain at scale ‚Äì that‚Äôs the main reason why I wanted to have tools to create graphs and pathfind in them. Turns out, it‚Äôs useful for plenty of other things :) . Special Thanks . Massive kudo to MikeC, who has been an early adopter, and whose feedback and suggestions tremendously helped make PCGEx a better and more useful tool &lt;3 Also thanks to Sinbad, as I shamelessly pasted some of his C++ formatting and practices for this documentation ^_^ . Source code . PCGEx is licensed under MIT : if you want to look at the code, or if you‚Äôre worried it could hurt your machine, the code is available in full on github. It does not rely on nor embbed any third party library/dlls. Bugs! . If you encounter a bug, please fill an issue here. Please provide as much information as you can (stack traces, node setup, ‚Ä¶).

For the example, let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre working on a cluster with 10 edges that have the following lengths: . Absolute lengths = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 55, 60, 1200, 500] Relative lengths = [0.0083, 0.016, 0.025, 0.03, 0.041, 0.041, 0.045, 0.05, 1, 0.41] . | Average | Median | Mode | Central | Fixed | . Average (Arithmetic mean) . Average mean is, well, the averaged value of all the lengths. Absolute Average Mean = 201.5 Relative Average Mean = 0.125 . Median . Median uses the median value of all the available lengths, sorted. Sorted Absolute lengths = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 50, 55, 60, 500, 1200] Absolute Median Mean = 50 // [.., 50, 50, ...] Sorted Relative lengths = [0.0083, 0.016, 0.025, 0.03, 0.041, 0.041, 0.045, 0.05, 0.41, 1] Relative Median Mean = 0.041 // [.., 0.041, 0.041, ...] . Mode (Shortest or Longest) . See Mode (statitics) on Wikipedia. If there are concurrent mode values (multiple buckets containing the same amount of values), the selected mode variant allows you to select either the mode with the shortest lengths, or the one with the longest out of the available conflicting modes. Absolute Mode Mean = 50 // [50, 50] is the largest bucket of equal values Absolute Mode Mean = 0.041 // [0.041, 0.041] is the largest bucket of equal values . In this is scenario, there is no conflicting frequencies. The Mode Tolerance property is used to fill frequency buckets based on equality with already sampled values. Central . Central uses the middle value between the shortest and longest lengths as mean. Absolute Central Mean = 605 // 10 + (1200-10)/2 Relative Central Mean = 0.504 // 0.0083 + (1-0.0083)/2 . Fixed . Fixed mean is basically user-defined mean. This is the way to go if you don‚Äôt care about statistics or if you have a consistent, metrics-driven setup. This is the least flexible but most performant approach as there is no need to sample any statistics prior to pruning. ",

Table of content . | Creating new collections | Rebuilding staging data | Available Collections | . Asset Collections are basically lists of assets that you can then use inside PCG; that all share some basic properties. They exist in different flavors, for different purposes (i.e actors vs meshes), but their main appeal over Data Table or PCG Data Asset is caching and nesting. Cached bounds data . Each entry has some basic information cached, amongst which the bounds of the referenced asset. This is especially useful as it allows nodes to access an asset bounds‚Äô without having to load the asset in memory. It enables nodes like Asset Staging to do some interesting work on points before spawning anything in the world. Nested collections . Each entry can be another collection. This is where the Asset Collection shines, because a collection can be weighted like any other entry. PCGEx will recognize sub-collection and will keep on digging in these until an asset is found. This is particulary handy when doing random weighted selection, where you want only a subset of items to be associated to a particular weight range, and then have a new random weighted pick from inside that range. Collections can be nested without limits, offering highly granular control over weighted &amp; random distribution. Re-usability &amp; templating . Since they‚Äôre regular DataAssets, Asset Collections can easily be extended, re-used, shared amongst different settings &amp; PCG setups. Convertible . In order to support any workflow, Asset Collection to Set makes it easy to convert any PCGEx‚Äô Asset Collection to a good ol‚Äô attribute set, on the fly. Note: Collections currently don‚Äôt properly check for circular dependencies, so be careful or you‚Äôre in for a ride. ",

    "content": "Although details vary a bit depending on the selected Search algorithm, the basic gist is, for each path &amp; cluster: . | Goal Pickers will find a suitable Seed and Goal point within the cluster. | The Search Algorithm will then find the best path that goes from Seed to Goal, accounting for its internal maths, and using üù∞ Heuristics as to determine whether one connection is better than another. | . Note: The Seed and Goal node are picked based on closest distance to input positions. Starting from the seed, each ‚Äúnext step‚Äù is weighted according to the V Vertex weight and the E Edge weight that connects to it. The search returns the path found with the lowest possible weight, or score. While the selected search algorithm is important, üù∞ Heuristics are more critical to the operation, as user-defined weights can drastically change and shape the path deemed best by the search. Note: The Plot nodes variations don‚Äôt have a goal picker and instead process each point Dataset as a list of points to go through from start to finish. The first point is the initial seed, the last point is the final goal, and then a path is found that goes through each point in-between, in order. ",

    "content": ". Side note that most PCGEx nodes are greedy, and contrary to vanilla nodes, they process all inputs in parallel instead of one after another. Most of the time it‚Äôs a non-issue, but may be noticeable if you have a lot of very large datasets plugged into the same node. Do Async Processing . Checked by default, you can toggle it off to force synchronous/unparallelized execution of the code. This is a very legacy option, best leave it to true. Chunk Size . The chunk size usually represents the number of point a node will process in a single parallel batch. There is no ideal value: too small and you loose the gain of parallelization, too high and you‚Äôre just hogging thread ressources. Ultimately, it depends on your specific setup. A value of -1 fallbacks to that specific‚Äô node default value under the hood. Unreal PCG plugin recommend a minimum batch size of 256, which is the default value I‚Äôm using for most of the nodes. Heavier operations can go as low as 32. Cache Result . Under the hood, all PCG node come with the ability to cache their result; but the system is designed so it‚Äôs a compile-time choice, not an editor-time one. I exposed the ability to cache on-demand at the price of some harmless asserts, because once you‚Äôre done iterating on certain settings, it‚Äôs worth caching the results. Be aware that the cache is easily corrupted, and sometime leads to missing points or data; it‚Äôs still a small price to pay when you‚Äôre working iteratively with hundreds of thousands points. Flatten Output . Flatten the output of this node. On 5.3 this is an absurdly expensive operation, it‚Äôs better in 5.4 and should be even faster in 5.5. Flattening ensure all inherited attribute values are copied to the output, and metadata parenting/inheritance is forfeited in the process. This is a required step to ensure attribute values are properly saved to PCG Data Assets! . ",

    "content": "| Performance Settings | ¬† | ¬† | . | Do Async Processing | Checked by default, you can toggle it off to force synchronous/unparallelized execution of the code. It‚Äôs usually a bad idea performance-wise. &gt; Note that synchronous execution still processes data in chunks, it just does it with guaranteed order, as opposed to parallel processing. | ¬† | . | Chunk Size | The chunk size represents the number of point/operations a node will process in a single parallel batch. There is no ideal value: too small and you loose the gain of parallelization, too high and you‚Äôre just hogging thread ressources. Ultimately, it depends on your specific setup.A value of -1 fallbacks to that specific‚Äô node default value under the hood, which is usually a generic sweet spot; ranging from 64 to 4096 depending on the node. | ¬† | . | Cache Result | Under the hood, all PCG node come with the ability to cache their result; but the system is designed so it‚Äôs a compile-time choice, not an editor-time one (at least in 5.3). I exposed the ability to cache on-demand at the price of some harmless asserts, because once you‚Äôre done iterating on certain settings, it‚Äôs worth caching the results. | ¬† | . | Flatten Output | When enabled, all of the node output attributes will be flattened; primarily meaning that their metadata (attributes) are not inheriting parents, and the node can be safely saved to a data asset. It‚Äôs a rather costly operation, so make sure you need it, and for the sake of your RAM, don‚Äôt enable it otherwise. | ## Weighting | . There is two weighting method available. Full Range and Effective Range. Each method outputs a [0..1] value that will be used to sample the Weight Over Distance curve. However, there is a critical nuance between the two: . | Full Range is a simple normalization, each target distance is divided by the longest one. As such, it‚Äôs very unlikely the curve will get sampled close to x=0. | Effective Range remaps each target distance using the shortest &amp; longest distance as min/max. As such, the shortest sampled distance will sample the curve at x=0, and the longest at x=1. | . Important note: when using the Within range sample method, some outputs will use the final weighted position/transforms for their calculations; although mathematically correct, this may yield unusuable/innacurate results.

There is no ideal value: too small and you loose the gain of parallelization, too high and you‚Äôre just hogging thread ressources. **Ultimately, it depends on your specific setup.**A value of -1 fallbacks to that specific‚Äô node default value under the hood, which is usually a generic sweet spot; ranging from 64 to 4096 depending on the node. | . | Cache Result | Under the hood, all PCG node come with the ability to cache their result; but the system is designed so it‚Äôs a compile-time choice, not an editor-time one **(at least in 5.3)**.

One of the main focus of PCGEx is working with Clusters : vtx &amp; edge-based ‚Äúgraph‚Äù structures. They‚Äôre akin to a mesh without faces: a bunch of vertices connected by a bunch of edges. PCGEx leverage PCG‚Äô point data as data holders in order to enable easy tweaking and manipulation of edge/vertice data using existing vanilla nodes. In short, a graph is represented by at least two separate set of points: the first, Vtx represent individual vertices; others, Edges, represent interconnected clusters. Edges points stores the indices of their start and end point in the matching Vtx group. Because of that approach, nodes that work with graph require Vtx and Edges as separate inputs. Data Tags are used to mark which edges match which vertices, so you will see additional tags appear on your data, formatted as PCGEx/Cluster::UID. Rule of thumb : If you manually alter (as in add or remove points) the content of a Vtx or Edges created by a PCGEx Node, make sure to use the Sanitize Clusters node before using them as inputs for other PCGEx nodes.
