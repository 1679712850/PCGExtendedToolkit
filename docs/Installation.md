# Installation

## Clone/Download repo

Either **Clone the repo** in your project' Plugins directory, or **download the repo and copy the content of the zip under a PCGExtendedToolkit folder** in your project' Plugins directory.

> At the time of writing, the plugin is not advanced enough to qualify for releases, but they're the safest way to go.

## Download a specific Release
Select a [github release](https://github.com/Nebukam/PCGExtendedToolkit/releases) and stick with it to avoid data loss with future udpates.  
Simply unzip the archive in your /Plugins folder, and you're good to go.  

This plugin uses Semantic Versioning, so:
- v 0.0.**N** should not affect your data
- v 0.**N**.0 should not affect your data, but may slightly affect your code if you expand on PCGEx functionality in c++.
- v **N**.0.0 is unsafe for your data.
