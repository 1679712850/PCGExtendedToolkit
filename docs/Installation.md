# Installation

There are at least two main ways you can look at this plugin.

## Github Release (Safe)
Select a github release and stick with it to avoid data loss with future udpates.  
Simply unzip the archive in your /Plugins folder, and you're good to go.  

This plugin uses Semantic Versioning, so:
- v 0.0.**N** should not affect your data
- v 0.**N**.0 should not affect your data, but may slightly affect your code if you expand on PCGEx functionality in c++.
- v **N**.0.0 is unsafe for your data.


## Clone this repo in your project' Plugins folder
If you're interested in extending the toolset yourself, or simply enjoy living dangerously, this is probably the most flexible approach.  
Simply clone the repo locally in your project' Plugins folder -- you're looking for trouble.
