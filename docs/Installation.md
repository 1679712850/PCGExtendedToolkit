# Installation

There are at least two main ways you can look at this plugin.

## Github Release (Safe)
Select a github release and stick with it to avoid data loss with future udpates.

## Clone this repo in your project' Plugins folder
If you're interested in extending the toolset yourself, or simply enjoy living dangerously, this is probably the most flexible approach.  
Simply clone the repo locally in your project' Plugins folder.
