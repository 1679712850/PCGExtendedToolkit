# PCGExtendedToolkit

# What is it?
 The PCG Extended Toolkit is a plugin for [Unreal engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) (5.3.1+) that contains a collection of low-level PCG Graph elements offering additional ways to manipulate and control PCG Data.

## PCGEx Nodes
### Sorting
> Nodes that sort points, to get better control over order-bound elements such as spline generation.

###  Relational
> Nodes that create and manipulate relationships between points

### Pathfinding
> Nodes that leverage relational data to create paths

### Misc
> Node that didn't fit in any category.

### Footnotes
- Effort to build this toolkit was originally inspired by the [PCG Pathfinding](https://github.com/spood/PCGPathfinding) repo 
- Since the lack of documentation around PCG at the time of writing, my approach to build things may not be the right one, nor the most optimal.
