# PCGExtendedToolkit ![BETA](https://img.shields.io/badge/BETA-ff0f0f)

# What is it?
 The PCG Extended Toolkit is a plugin for [Unreal engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/) (5.3.1+) that contains a collection of **low-level PCG Graph elements** offering additional ways to manipulate and control PCG Data.

## PCGEx Nodes
Generally speaking, each node is meant to encapsulate very atomic behaviors; in order to stay flexible and maintainable. This means there isn't a single "magic" node, but rather a toolkit of small-scoped elements that works together.  
See the [Full documentation index](docs/Index.md) for an overview of the new nodes and concepts introduced by **PCGEx**!

### Footnotes
- Effort to build this toolkit was originally inspired by the [PCG Pathfinding](https://github.com/spood/PCGPathfinding) repo 
- Since the lack of documentation around PCG at the time of writing, my approach to build things may not be the right one, nor the most optimal.
