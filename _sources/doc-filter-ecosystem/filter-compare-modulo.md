# Properties
<br>

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| **Operand A**          ||
| Operand A          | The first attribute of the comparison. |

| **Operand B**          ||
| Operand B Source          |  Type of operand B. Can be a per-point `Attribute`, or an easily overridable `Constant`. |
| Compare B (Attribute) | Attribute to use as Operand B. |
| Compare B (Constant) | Constant value to use as Operand B. |

| **Comparison**          ||
| Comparison | How to compare the two `A % B` against `C`.<br>*See [Numeric comparisons](/PCGExtendedToolkit/doc-general/comparisons.html#numeric-comparisons).* |
| Compare Against | Type of operand C. Can be a per-point `Attribute`, or an easily overridable `Constant`. |

| **Operand C**          ||
| Operand C | Attribute that contains the per-point operand B value. |
| Operand C (Attribute) | Attribute to use as Operand C. |
| Operand C (Constant) | Constant value to use as Operand C. |
| Tolerance | Equality tolerance using an approximative comparison. |
