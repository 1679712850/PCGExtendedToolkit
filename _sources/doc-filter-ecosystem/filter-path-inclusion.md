{% include header_card_node %}

The **Path Inclusion** filter checks the spatial relationship of a point against input paths; i.e are they inside, outside, on, or a combination.
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 } 

> Note that to simplify operations, this node create a temporary spline in memory from the input paths; althought it does not support custom tangents. Should you need custom tangents, use {% include lk id='Create Spline' %} with {% include lk id='üùñ Spline Inclusion' %} instead.

| **Settings**          ||
| Point Type         | Point type used for the proxy spline generated by the input paths. |
| Sample Inputs         | Lets you filter out input paths based on whether they're closed loops or not. |
| Check Type         | *See below.* |
| Pick         | Lets you choose which path to test against. |
| Tolerance         | Distance to the path within which a point is considered to be `On` the path. |
| Spline Scales Tolerance         | If enabled, the `Tolerance` value will be scaled by the spline' `YZ` scale' length.<br>*Note that this will be the path' points YZ scale.* |
| Invert         | If enabled, inverts the result of the filter. |
