| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| **Operand A**          ||
| Operand A          | The first attribute of the comparison.<br>*Read as `FVector` direction.* |
| Transform Operand A          | If enabled, the Operand A direction will be transformed by the tested' point transform. |

| **Operand B**          ||
| Compare Against | Type of operand B. Can be a per-point `Attribute`, or an easily overridable `Constant`. |
| Operand B<br>*(Constant or Attribute)* | Operand B value, used to compute the dot product with.<br>*Read as `FVector` direction.* |
| Transform Operand A          | If enabled, the Operand A direction will be transformed by the tested' point transform. |
