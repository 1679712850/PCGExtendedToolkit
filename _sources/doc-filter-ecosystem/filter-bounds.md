# Properties
<br>

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Bounds Source          | Lets you pick which point' bounds will be used for the Bounds inputs.<br>-`Scaled Bounds` is closest to what you see using a `Debug` node.<br>-`Density Bounds` are the same as `Scaled Bounds` but factor in the local density of the point.<br>-`Bounds` uses unscaled bounds. |
| Check if Inside | If enabled, the filter **passes if the tested point is inside the provided bounds**; otherwise it passes if the tested point is **outside**.  |
| Inside Epsilon | Lets you set a small value that will be used to expand the bounds in order to rule out perfect surface overlaps. |
