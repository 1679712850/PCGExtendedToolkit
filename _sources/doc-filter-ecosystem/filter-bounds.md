# Properties
<br>

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Bounds Source          | Defines the bounds to be used for tested points. |
| Bounds Target          | Defines the bounds to be used for the input `Bounds` points. |
| Check Type | The type of bounds x bounds check the filter will do. |
| Inside Epsilon | Lets you set a small value that will be used to expand the target bounds. |

## Check Type

Defines how source bounds are checked against the target bounds. These are fairly standard box/box operations.  

> Note that the source bounds are first transformed by their point' transform, and then inverse transformed by the target' point transform; meaning there can be some artifacts and mathematical variations as a result of applying the matrices.
