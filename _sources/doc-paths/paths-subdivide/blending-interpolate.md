## Blend Over Methods

- [Distance](#distance)
- [Count](#count)
- [Fixed](#fixed)

### Distance
{% include img a='details/modules/blendover-distance.png' %}  

`Distance` will first calculate the total distance covered by the subpoints (*from current to next*), and compute their individual lerp as `Local Distance / Total Distance`.  
**This usually gives more better-looking results if the distance between points is irregular;** but the difference in values between a point and the next can either be brutal or negligible.

*If points are equally spaced, it will look very similar to `Point Count`.*

### Count
{% include img a='details/modules/blendover-index.png' %}  

`Point Count` uses the current point index, and compute their individual lerp as `Current Index / Total Point Count`.
**Using this method is equivalent of using a fixed blending step between each point.**

*If points are irregularly spaced, it may look a bit random.*

### Fixed
Uses a unique fixed lerp value for each point.
