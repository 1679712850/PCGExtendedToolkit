subtitle: A Create Spline node with per-point controls & tagging abilities.
color: white
summary: The **Create Spline** node lets you create spline data & components from paths' points. It is exactly like the regular `Create Spline` node, with a few extended features, such as spline point type & component tagging.

|**Settings**||
| Mode      | What type of data will be generated by the node. Either `Data Only`, or `Component` as well.   |
| Default Point Type      | Default point type for the spline.<br>See [Point Types](#point-types)   |
| Apply Custom Point Type      | If enabled, will use a per-point attribute to drive the spline point type. |
| Point Type Attribute      | The attribute which value will be used to select point type. |

|**Settings**||
| Apply Custom Tangents           | When enabled, applies `FVector` tangents attributes to spline points. |
| Arrive Tangent Attribute           | Per-point attribute to read the arrive tangent from. |
| Leave Tangent Attribute           | Per-point attribute to read the leave tangent from. |

> Note that custom tangents are only used by the <span class="ebit">Curve Custom Tangent</span> point type!
