subtitle: Outputs a 2D Voronoi graph.
summary: The **Voronoi 2D** node outputs a 2D Voronoi graph with options like balanced, canon, or centroid positioning. Adjust bounds, prune sites, and mark edges on the hull.

{% include header_card_node %}

This node creates a 2D Voronoi diagram from the input points. If you'd like to know more about Voronoi intrinsic properties, check out the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)!

# Properties
<br>

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|: **Settings** :|
| Method           | Defines how the position of the Voronoi site is computed. *See below for more infos.* |
| Expand Bounds           | Value added on each axis of the initial input points bounds, used for maths & processes involving bounds. |
| Prune Out of Bounds           | Depending on the selected method, the diagram will produce out-of-bounds points *(up to Â±inf)*. Enabling this option lets you remove those points from the output. |
| <span class="eout">Hull Attribute Name</span><br>`Boolean`          | If enabled, will flag output `Vtx` points that lie on the convex hull of the underlying Delaunay diagram.<br>*Note that this is not the exact hull, but rather an approximation.* |
| Mark Edge on Touch          | If enabled, edges that have at least a point on the Hull as marked as being on the hull; *as opposed to only be marked as hull edges if both endpoints are on the hull.* |

> Note that enabling `Prune Out of Bounds` points has a theorical risk of creating more than one finite cluster as a result.

## Voronoi site position

| Mode       | |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| {% include img a='placeholder.jpg' %} | **Centroid**<br>Uses the centroid of the Delaunay site.<br>*While more visually pleasing, some concave sites may appear depending on the initial topology.* |
| {% include img a='placeholder.jpg' %} | **Canon (Circumcenter)**<br>Uses the [circumcenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcircle) of the Delaunay triangle.<br>*This is the true voronoi algorithm, it guarantees only convex sites.* |
| {% include img a='placeholder.jpg' %} | **Centroid**<br>Uses the centroid of the Delaunay site for the point that are outside the bounds, otherwise use circumcenters.<br>*Best of both worlds, or worst of both worlds; depending on how you look at it.* |
