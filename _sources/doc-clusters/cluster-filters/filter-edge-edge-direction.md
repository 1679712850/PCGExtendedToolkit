# Properties
<br>

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|: **Settings (Operand A)** ||
|: Direction Settings | Used to determine which edge endpoint is either the start or end.<br>*See below.* |
| Comparison Quality          | Defines the method used for comparison.<br>- `Dot` is precise *(easily returns false)*<br>- `Hash` method is approximative *(easily returns true)* |

|: **Operand B** ||
| Compare Against | Type of operand B. Can be a per-edge point `Attribute`, or an easily overridable `Constant`. |
| Direction<br>`FVector` | Attribute to read the direction vector to compare the edge direction against. |
| Direction Constant | Constant direction vector to compare the edge direction against. |
| Transform Direction | If enabled, the direction to compare will be adjusted by the current edge point' transform.<br>*If disabled, the direction is in world space.* |
