# Properties
<br>

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|: **Settings** ||
| Threshold Input | Type of threshold value. Can be a per-edge point `Attribute`, or an easily overridable `Constant`. |
| Threshold Constant           | Constant threshold value. |
| Threshold Attribute<br>`int32` | Attribute to read the threshold to compare the number of connections against. |
| Mode | Define how the number of endpoint' connections should be aggregated (or not) before the comparison is processed. |
| Comparison | How the number of neighbors should be compared against the threshold.<br>*See [Numeric comparisons](/PCGExtendedToolkit/doc-general/general-comparisons.html#numeric-comparisons).* |
| Tolerance | Equality tolerance for near-value comparisons. |
| Invert | If enabled, invert the result of the filter. |

### Mode

| <span class="ebit">Sum</span>           | The sum of adjacencies will be compared against the specified threshold. |
| <span class="ebit">Any</span>           | At least one endpoint adjacency count must pass the comparison against the specified threshold. |
| <span class="ebit">Both</span>           | Both endpoint adjacency count must individually pass the comparison against the specified threshold. |
