This test each edge for possible overlap/intersection with other edges in the same cluster.
*By design, the output is guaranteed to be sanitized (e.g, each cluster will retains its existing connectivity properties).*

# Properties

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|:**Settings** :|
| Keep          | When checking two edges, defines which one will be preserved, and which one will be removed. |
| Tolerance           | The distance at which two edges are considered to be overlapping.<br>*The higher the value, the more aggressive the pruning.* |

|: **Limits** :|
| Min Angle           | If enabled, will only check overlap if the two edges have **at least** the specified angle between each other. |
| Max Angle           | If enabled, will only check overlap if the two edges hace **at most** the specified angle between each other. |

> This refinement can be rather expensive depending on the topology of the clusters.
