summary: The **Special Neighbors** property outputs information about two key neighbors of a vertex ‚Äî the one with the most connections (Largest Neighbor) and the one with the fewest connections (Smallest Neighbor). You can extract various attributes, such as edge direction, length, and vertex indices, for both of these special neighbors.

The **Special Neighbor** property outputs the properties of the two "special" connected neighbors -- special in the *outlier* sense : the **Largest** connected vtx, as well as the **Smallest** connected vtx -- in terms of number of connectons.

## Largest Neighbor

> The Largest Neighbor is the connected `Vtx` with the largest number of connections.

## Smallest Neighbor

> The Smallest Neighbor is the connected `Vtx` with the smallest number of connections.
