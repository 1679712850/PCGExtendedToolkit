summary: The **Flag Nodes** node identifies and marks complex, non-mutually exclusive states within a cluster by applying filters and conditions to bitmask attributes, allowing for fine-tuned control over node selection and flagging based on specific criteria.

{% include header_card_node %}

The **Flag Nodes** node helps you find & mark complex, non-mutually exclusive states on each `Vtx` of a cluster. It takes any number of {% include lk id='Node Flag' %} and processes their associated filters & conditions in order to update a bitmask attribute on individual points. **It is primarily used to identify nodes within a graph that meet very specific set of criterias that are not mutually exclusive**.  
Output attribute can then be filtered using {% include lk id='üùñ Bitmask' %}, and works with the {% include lk id='Bitmasks' %} toolset.

Bitmasks & bit fields can be obscure to work with if it's not something you're used to. Sadly the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)) on the topic isn't super helpful, and digging into the specifics wouldn't be very productive either. *If you have a user-friendly resources I could add to the doc, please poke me.*  

> Bitmasks fields in PCGEx are using a `int64`, which **loosely translate as storing 63 boolean values on a single attribute**.

# Order of operation

Connected {% include lk id='Flag Node' %}s are first sorted (ascending) using their individual `Priority`, and then processed in that order; **using the result of the previous operation, if any.**  
What this means is higher priorities have the ability to radically change the entire bitmask, should you chose to.  
*It synergize very well with the {% include lk id='Conditional Actions' %} node that lets you match & set attributes using filters; such as the {% include lk id='üùñ Bitmask' %} one.*
