{% include header_card_node %}

The adjacency filter does a simple numeric comparison on each individual connections of a `Vtx`, and offer fine grained control over what qualifies as a "success", based on how many connections passed the comparison or not. *What makes it equally useful and tricky to set-up is its ability to test against either a discrete number of connection, or relative ones.*
