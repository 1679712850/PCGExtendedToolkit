The Edge Direction filter does a simple dot product comparison on each individual connections' direction, and offer fine grained control over what qualifies as a "success", based on how many directions passed the comparison or not. *What makes it equally useful and tricky to set-up is its ability to test against either a discrete number of connection, or relative ones.*
