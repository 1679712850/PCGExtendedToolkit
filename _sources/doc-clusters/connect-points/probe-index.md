# Properties

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Mode          | How the node is to interpret the target index value. |
| Index Safety           | *Index safety is a recurring mechanism in PCGEx, see below for more infos.* |

|: **Target Index Settings** :|
| Target Index           | The type of value used for this probe' index source; either a `Constant` value or fetched from an`Attribute` |
| Target <br>*(Constant or Attribute)*           | Index pick or constant offset depending on the selected `Mode`. |

### Mode

|: Mode     | Description|
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Target           | Use the target index value as a raw index to connect to. |
| One-way Offset         | Use the target index value as an offset to the currently probed point' index. |
| Two-way Offset         | Use the target index value as an offset to the currently probed point' index; and creates a second connection but this time using the **target index value multiplied by -1.** |
