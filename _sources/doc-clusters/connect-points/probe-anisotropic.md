{% include header_card_node %}

An anisotropic probe is a preset to find connection in 16 different directions over the `X` & `Y` axis.  
*Anisotropic pathfinding is a popular approach to finding high-level plots, it made sense to have an hardcoded version as opposed to hand crafting 16 directional probes to the same effect*

# Properties

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|: **Settings** :|
| Transform Direction          | If enabled, the direction of the probe will be adjusted by the current probing point' transform.<br>*If disabled, the direction is in world space.* |

|: **Search Radius** :|
| Search Radius Source           | The type of value used for this probe' search radius; either a `Constant` value or fetched from an`Attribute` |
| Search Radius <br>*(Constant or Attribute)*           | Radius of the probe.<br>*Dynamic radiuses can be super expensive if they are different for each probe: search will use the greatest radius to sample to octree for this point.* |

> Contrary to {% include lk id='üùÜ Direction' %}, the anisotropic probe will *always* favor alignment over distance.
> *Because of that, it often yields more 'canon' results with grid-aligned points.*
