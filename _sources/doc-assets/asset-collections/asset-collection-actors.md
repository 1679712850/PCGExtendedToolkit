# Properties
<br>

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Entries           | Entries are a list of actors (soft) references and their associated shared properties.<br>*You really just need to set the Actor property for it to work.* |
| Do Not Ignore Invalid Entries          | Forces distribution of this to NOT skip over invalid entries.<br>This can be useful to create 'weighted' spaces, and can be overriden on a per-node basis. |

|: **Advanced** :||
| Auto Rebuild Staging           | Enabled by default.<br>When enabled, any user-made modification to the asset collection will trigger a rebuilding of the staging data *(saves you a click, in case your forget about it.)* |
