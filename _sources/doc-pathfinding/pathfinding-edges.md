| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|**Goal Picker**| The module that will be used to interpret and manipulate goals and seeds inputs.<br>*Each module has individual settings and documentation -- See [Available Goal Pickers](#available--goal-pickers-modules).*|

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
|**Plot inclusiong**||
| Add Seed to Path           | Prepends the *seed position* at the beginning of the output path.<br>*This will create a point with the position of the seed.* |
| Add Goal to Path           | Appends the *goal position* at the end of the output path.<br>*This will create a point with the position of the goal.* |
| Path Composition           | Whether the output paths are made from `Vtx` or `Edges` points. |

|**Picking**||
| Seed Picking         | Lets you control how the seed node (`Vtx`) will be picked based on the provided seed position. |
| Goal Picking         | Lets you control how the goal node (`Vtx`) will be picked based on the provided goal position. |
| **Search Algorithm**         | Let you pick which {% include lk id='‚äö Search' %} algorithm to use to resolve pathfinding. |
