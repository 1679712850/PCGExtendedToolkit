The **Azimuth** heuristic favors traversing edges that are directed toward the search goal.  
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 } 

From a purely result perspective, it may *look* like a shortest path because it tend to produce more "straight" results going from seed to goal (if the topologies allows for it), but under the hood it's a very different logic.  This heuristics works best when combined with other more intricate ones to enforce some visual stability to the path.
