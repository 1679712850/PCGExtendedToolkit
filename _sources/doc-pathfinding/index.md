> Pathfinding modules for {% include lk id='Pathfinding' %} nodes. Key steps include heuristic computation, goal picking, and search algorithms finding the best path based on weighted connections. {% include lk id='üù∞ Heuristics' %} and their weights are key to the operation. *Note: Plot nodes handle point datasets differently, finding a path through each point in order.*

## How pathfinding works
Although details vary a bit depending on the selected {% include lk id='‚äö Search' %} algorithm, the basic gist is, for each path & cluster:
1. {% include lk id='üùì Goal Pickers' %} will find a suitable `Seed` and `Goal` point within the cluster.
2. The Search Algorithm will then find the best path that goes from `Seed` to `Goal`, accounting for its internal maths, and using {% include lk id='üù∞ Heuristics' %} as to determine whether one connection is better than another.

>Note: The `Seed` and `Goal` node are picked based on closest distance to input *positions*.

Starting from the seed, each "next step" is weighted according to the `V` Vertex weight and the `E` Edge weight that connects to it.  
The search returns the path found **with the lowest possible weight**, or *score*.

While the selected search algorithm is important, {% include lk id='üù∞ Heuristics' %} are more critical to the operation, as user-defined weights can drastically change and shape the path deemed best by the search.

>Note: The `Plot` nodes variations don't have a goal picker and instead process each point Dataset as *a list of points to go through from start to finish*. The first point is the initial seed, the last point is the final goal, and then a path is found that goes through each point in-between, in order.
