# Numeric comparisons
<br>

| Comparison       | Data          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| `==`           | Strictly equal. |
| `!=`           | Strictly not equal. |
| `>=`           | Equal or greater. |
| `<=`           | Equal or smaller. |
| `>`           | Strictly greater. |
| `<`           | Strictly smaller. |
| `~=`           | Nearly equal. |
| `!~=`           | Nearly not equal. |

> Approximative comparison will reveal an additional parameter, dubbed `Tolerance`. This represents the size of acceptable approximation for the comparison to pass.
> For example, when checking if `0.5 ~= 0.4` with a tolerance of `0.1` will return `true`.

> Large tolerances can be a great, cheap way to achieve results akin to a "within range" comparison!

# String comparisons
<br>

| Comparison       | Data          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| `==`           | Strictly equal. |
| `!=`           | Strictly not equal. |
| `== (Length)`           | String lengths are strictly equal. |
| `!= (Length)`           | String lengths are strictly not equal. |
| `>= (Length)`           | String length is equal or greater. |
| `<= (Length)`           | String lengths are is equal or smaller. |
| `> (Length)`           | String lengths is strictly greater. |
| `< (Length)`           | String lengths is Strictly smaller. |
| `> (Locale)`           | String locale is strictly greater.<br>*In alphabetical order. (Z is greater than A)* |
| `< (Locale)`           | String locale is strictly smaller.<br>*In alphabetical order. (A is smaller than Z)* |
| `Contains`           | Check if string is contained in another one.<br>*Useful if you have solid naming conventions.* |
| `Starts With`           | Check if the string starts with another one.<br>*Useful for prefixes.* |
| `Ends With`           | Check if the string ends with another one.<br>*Useful for suffixes.* |
