summary: This page centralizes documentation for Blending, allowing us to keep relevant content accessible without duplicating extensive details across individual pages; as many nodes have blending capabilities.

There's a lot of node in PCGEx that offer blending settings -- and while *what* is blended is highly contextual, they all share the same settings. 
{: .fs-5 .fw-400 } 

Generally speaking, blending happens between at least two points, but it can sometimes be more, much more.  
When a node creates new points, the final point' properties and attributes is usually the result of all other blended points -- however, certain nodes blend point properties *into an existing point* which changes slightly the behavior of the selected blendmode.

# Properties
<br>

| Property       | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| Blending Filter           | How to filter which attributes are going to be blended.<br>*This only applies to attribute, not points properties*. |
| Filtered Attributes           | Based on the selected filter above, this is the list of attributes that will have to match it.<br>If the filter is inclusive (`Include`), only the listed attributes will be blended.<br>If the filter is exclusive (`Exclude`), listed attribute won't be blended, but every other will be. |
| Default Blending           | This is the default blending applied to both point' Attributes and Properties.<br>*Per-attribute & per-property blending can be different.* |
| Properties Overrides           | Lets you select per-property override modes, if you want them to be different from the selected default. |
| Attribute Overrides           | Lets you select per-attribute override modes, if you want them to be different from the selected default. |
