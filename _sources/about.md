I made **PCGEx** as a way to bring some my personal Houdini toolkit into Unreal, and figured it could be useful to my fellow artists and designers.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

I love my current workflow & tools when it comes to procedural generation, and often needed ways to generate data & structures to... well, generate *more* data and structures to spawn stuff on.  
Unreal PCG has powerful tools to generate and work with splines, but unless you're making them by hand, spline are a pain to manipulate and maintain at scale -- that's the main reason why I wanted to have tools to create graph and pathfinding them. Turns out, it's useful for plenty of other things :)

### Special Thanks
Massive kudo to MikeC, who has been an early adopter, and whose feedback and suggestions tremendously helped make PCGEx a better and more useful tool <3   
*Also thanks to [Sinbad](https://github.com/sinbad), as I shamelessly pasted some of his C++ formatting and practices for this documentation ^_^*
